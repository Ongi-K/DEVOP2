<!--
This Vue component is dedicated to displaying a list of notes or tasks. It encapsulates its own template, script, and scoped styles, making it a self-contained and reusable piece of the application. The component is designed to be extended in the future with interactive features like data fetching and editing functionality.

  // Future enhancements: define props, data, and methods to manage note interactions
};
