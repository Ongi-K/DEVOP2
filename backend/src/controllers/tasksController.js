/*
This controller file contains the business logic for managing tasks and notes. It defines functions such as getAllTasks and createTask that handle incoming requests, process data (such as interacting with a database), and send responses back to the client. By isolating this logic, the code remains modular and easier to test and maintain.
*/

// Handles business logic for tasks/notes operations.
// Define functions: getAllTasks, createTask, etc.
exports.getAllTasks = (req, res) => {
  // Placeholder: Retrieve tasks from the database
  res.json({ message: 'Retrieve all tasks' });
};

exports.createTask = (req, res) => {
  // Placeholder: Create a new task with data from req.body
  res.json({ message: 'Task created successfully' });
};

// Add more functions as needed
